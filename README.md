# **Hi, I'm Will Friedman**

**Product Leader & AI-Native Builder**

I'm a Product Executive with 20+ years of experience scaling platforms and developer ecosystems (Headspace, 98point6, Microsoft). I've evolved from a Technical Evangelist into a Product Leader and hands-on **AI Practitioner**, using tools like Cursor, Copilot, and Claude to build software myself.

I believe in dogfooding developer tools to understand the *actual* workflows we aim to accelerate.

### **🚀 What I'm Building (AI & DevTools)**

I treat myself as "Customer Zero" for the AI coding lifecycle. Here are a few things I've built recently using **GitHub Copilot**, **Cursor**, and **Claude**:

* 🏥 **Veritell (Caregiver Support):** Developing an AI-powered application that interprets complex medical records into comprehensible, actionable information for caregivers.  
* 🤖 **WaitOnlineForYou (Web Automation Agent):** Developed a custom monitoring agent for high-demand reservations (Notre Dame in Paris) that continuously scans for availability and sends instant alerts. Solved a real-world user pain point. (See [WaitOnlineForYou](https://www.waitonlineforyou.com/)).  
* 📱 **Aikido iOS App (LLM-Generated):** Architected and shipped a 5-star iOS app for Tenzan Aikido practitioners. I collaborated with **ChatGPT**, **Claude Code**, and **Cursor** with Composer 1 to handle the entire dev lifecycle, from SwiftUI to logic.  
* 📊 **Career Data Analyzer (Streamlit):** Built a Python/Streamlit app to analyze career data, demonstrating how rapidly we can spin up internal tooling.

### **🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools**

* **AI Pair Programming:** Cursor, Claude 3.5 Sonnet  
* **Focus Areas:** Generative AI, RCM/EHR Integrations, Platform Strategy, API Ecosystems
